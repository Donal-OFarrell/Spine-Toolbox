The settings have been categorized into *General*, *GAMS*, *Julia*, *Data Store views*, and *Project* settings. The
*General*, *GAMS*, *Julia*, and *Data Store views* settings are general application settings, which affect all
projects. Settings in the *Project* category only affect the current project.
