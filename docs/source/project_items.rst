*************
Project Items
*************

Project items in the *Design view* and the connections between them make up the graph (Directed Acyclic Graph, DAG)
that is executed when the |execute| or |execute-selected| buttons are pressed.

See :ref:`Executing Tools` for more information on how the DAG is processed by Spine Toolbox.

The following items are currently available:

Data Store |data_store|
-----------------------

A Data store item represents a connection to a Spine model database.
Currently, the item supports sqlite and mysql dialects.
The database can be accessed and modified using :ref:`data store views <Data store views>`
available from the item's properties or from a right-click context menu.

Data Connection |data_connection|
---------------------------------

A Data connection item provides access to data files.
It also provides access to the :ref:`Datapackage editor <Spine datapackage editor>`.

Tool |tool|
-----------

Tool is the heart of a DAG. It is usually the actual model to be executed in Spine Toolbox
but can be an arbitrary script or executable as well.
A tool is specified by its :ref:`template <Tool template editor>`.

View |view|
-----------

A View item is meant for inspecting data from multiple sources using the
:ref:`data store views <Data store views>`.
Note that the data is opened in read-only mode so modifications are not possible from the View item.

.. note::

   Currently, only *Tree view* supports multiple databases.

Data Interface |data_interface|
-------------------------------

This item provides mapping from tabulated data (comma separated values, Excel) to the Spine data model.
