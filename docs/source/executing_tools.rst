Executing Projects
******************
This section describes how executing a project works. Execution happens by pressing the |play-all| or the |play-selected|
buttons in the main window tool bar. A project consists of project items and connections (yellow arrows) that
are visualized on the *Design View*. You use the project items and the connections to build a **Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG)**, with the project items as *nodes* and the connections as *edges*. A DAG is traversed using the
**breadth-first-search** algorithm.

Rules of DAGs:

1. A single project item with no edges is a DAG.
2. All project items that are connected, are considered as a single DAG. It does not matter, which direction the
   edges go. If there is a path between two nodes, they are considered as belonging to the same DAG.
3. Loops are not allowed (this is what acyclic means).

You can connect the nodes in the *Design View* how ever you want but you cannot execute the resulting DAGs if they break
the rules above. Here is an example project with three DAGs.

.. image:: img/example_dags.png
   :align: center

- DAG 1: nodes: a, b, c, d. edges: a-b, a-c, b-d, c-d
- DAG 2: nodes: e, f. edges: e-f
- DAG 3: nodes: g. edges: None

When you press the |play-all| button, all three DAGs are executed in a row. You can see the progress and the current
executed node in the *Event Log*. Execution order of DAG 1 is *a->b->c->d* or
*a->c->b->d* since nodes b and c are siblings. DAG 2 execution order is *e->f* and DAG 3 is just *g*. If you have
a DAG in your project that breaks the rules above, that DAG is skipped and the execution continues with the next DAG.

You can execute a single DAG in the project by selecting a node in the desired DAG and pressing the |play-selected|
button in the tool bar. For example, to execute only DAG 1 you can select (in *Design View* or in the project item
list in *Project* dock widget) any of the nodes a, b, c, or d and then press the |play-selected| button.

.. tip::
   If you are not sure how execution works in your DAG, you can test the execution just like in the above picture
   by adding and connecting empty Data Connection items and then pressing the play buttons.

Executing Tools as a part of the DAG
====================================
All project items in the DAG are *executed*, but the real processing only happens when a Tool project item is
executed. When you have created at least one Tool specification, you can execute a Tool as part of the DAG. The Tool
specification defines the process that is depicted by the Tool project item. As an example, below we have two project
items; *Julia Model* Tool and *Data File* Data Connection connected as a DAG with an edge between the nodes.

   :align: center

Selecting the *Julia Model* shows its properties in the *Properties* dock widget. In the top of the Tool
Properties, there is a specification drop-down menu. From this drop-down menu, you can select the Tool specification for this
particular Tool item. The *Example Tool specification* tool specification has been selected for the Tool *Julia Model*. Below
the drop-down menu, you can see the details of the Tool specification, command line arguments, Source files (the first
one is the main program file), Input files, Optional input files and Output files. *Results...* button opens the
Tool's result archive directory in the File Explorer (all Tools have their own result directory). The *Execute in*
radio buttons control, whether this Tool is first copied to a work directory and executed there, or if the execution
should happen in the source directory where the main program file is located.

.. note::
   The *Example Tool specification* has been modified a bit from previous sections. It now requires an *Input file*
   *data.csv*.

When you click on the |play-all| button, the execution starts from the *Data File* Data Connection. When executed,
Data Connection items *advertise* their files and references to project items that are in the same DAG and
executed after them. In this particular example, the *Data File* item contains a file called *data.csv* as depicted
in the below picture.

   :align: center

When it's the *Julia Model* tools turn to be executed, it checks if it finds the file *data.csv* from project items,
that have already been executed. When the DAG is set up like this, the Tool finds the input file that it requires
and then starts processing the Tool specification starting with the main program file *script.jl*. Note that if the edge
would be the other way around (from *Julia Model* to *Data File*) execution would start from the *Julia Model* and it
would fail because it cannot find the required file *data.csv*. The same thing happens if there is no edge between the
two project items. In this case the project items would be in separate DAGs.

Since the Tool specification type was set as *Julia* and the main program is a Julia script, Spine Toolbox starts the execution in the
Julia Console (if you have selected this in the application *Settings*,
See :ref:`Settings` section).

Tool execution algorithm
========================
The below figure depicts what happens when a Tool item with a valid Tool specification is executed.
